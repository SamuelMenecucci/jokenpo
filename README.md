# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

College project, a version in Javascript and a version in C++.

A very popular game is Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this game, players must simultaneously show a hand sign indicating which of the three elements (rock, paper, or scissors) they will play. Each of the elements wins against one and loses to the other two:

* Rock crushes scissors;
* Paper wraps rock;
* Scissors cut paper.

An extended version, containing two new symbols - lizard and Spock - was popularized by the American TV series The Big Bang Theory. In this more advanced version, each element wins against two elements and loses to the other two. Thus, the relationships are as follows:

* Rock crushes scissors;
* Rock crushes lizard;
* Paper wraps rock;
* Paper disproves Spock;
* Scissors cut paper;
* Scissors decapitate lizard;
* Lizard poisons Spock;
* Lizard eats paper;
* Spock vaporizes rock;
* Spock smashes scissors.
